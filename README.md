# Reminder

Allows you to manage your notes regarding future events and pops out a window at the system boot (if you set it in 
"Set autorun.exe") displaying all messages linked with this certain day. It can be just a date stated by day/month or either day of week. Past events are deleted if you don't tick the "constant" option in them, which is not fitted with days of week.

"Add tasks.exe" - your interface allowing you adding and deleting your planned events.
"Reminder.exe" - pops up events for current day and deletes ones that have past.
"Set autorun.exe" - kind of "installer tool". You can turn on and off executing "Reminder.exe" at system boot in it.
 
 
 
Still needs to solve the issue with not working key added to Run in Registry.
The "important" value in DB is unused at this moment, will be marking certain messages in the future.
